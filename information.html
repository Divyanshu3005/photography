<p style='font-size:20px; text-align:center;'> The first photograph was taken in 1826, 
creators have been using this skill to capture images of the world around them.
 Photography allows people to document events, moments in time, and things they have seen.
 It can also help human beings gain a better understanding of the world, in the case of 
scientific photography or photojournalism. Photography is also an artistic medium—the
 Photographer presents their interpretation of the human experience through what they choose
 to document and the perspective their photos show. <br> <br>

Another important aspect of photography is that photographic images can be reproduced, 
allowing them to be circulated and distributed worldwide. Even before digital photography,
 a film photograph was easier to reproduce than the paintings and drawings that had previously 
been the best way to convey an image. One early example of how the new technology of photography
 rapidly came to shape the world is the work of Matthew Brady. His photos documenting the 
American Civil War showed the brutality of the war’s impact, powerfully influencing public
opinion about the conflict.
